# actuary-salary-prediction
Machine learning model to predict actuary salaries using Python and scikit-learn

## Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning model to predict actuary salaries using demographic, educational, and job-related features.

## Problem Statement
Actuary salaries vary depending on several factors such as:
- Industry
- Education level
- Years of experience
- Job role and location

Can we predict an actuary’s salary using observable characteristics

## Skills & Concepts Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling missing data correctly  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Machine learning pipelines  
- Model comparison and evaluation  
- Reproducible research practices
